Currently, I have received my master's degree and am ready to work in industry. 
But my next plan is to pass the IELTS to apply for a PhD. Good luck to myself.

Projects
---
* **Formal verification of SysML state machine graph models**
  > 2022.09 -- 2023.01  
  > Laboratory and **Huawei** cooperation project.  
  > Designed the metamodel for the state machine model (in the SysML) and the Uppaal model, and mapping rules for the elements between the two models. An automatic transformation tool was developed for direct transformation.

* **Formal verification of key functional high-level requirements for multiprocessor time-sharing and partition operation system**
  > 2021.10 -- 2022.03  
  > Laboratory and **COMAC** cooperation project.  
  > he multiprocessor time-sharing and partition operating system is an important part of the avionics system. The analysis and formal verification of the high-level requirements of key functions are mainly focused.

* **Formal verification of high-security BIOS for cryptographic platforms** 
  > 2020.10 -- 2021.10  
  > Laboratory and **CETC** cooperation project.  
  > Review the source code of the "DXE" part of the BIOS, model the phase with formal methods, and formally verify the source code using techniques based on Hoare logic and weakest preconditioning.
